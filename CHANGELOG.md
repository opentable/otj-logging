otj-logging
===========

5.2.2
-----
* Rename the configuration @Values for blacklist => blocklist
   * ot.httpserver.request-log.startswith-blacklist => ot.httpserver.request-log.startswith-blocklist
   * ot.httpserver.request-log.equality-blacklist =>> ot.httpserver.request-log.equality-blocklist
* Add to the default startswith-blocklist (was /health) /infra/health, /infra/ready to suppress logging by default in Platorm 3 (just like /health).
   * If you want them (for debugging), just supply ot.httpserver.request-log.startswith-blocklist=/foobar (or such)

Opengrok seems to show only Front Door (and some very old services) configured these values. If you do use them
you'll need to rename blacklist => blocklist

* The above change in turn changed the getters of JsonRequestLogConfig - you'll have to correct this. It also
  breaks binary compatibility of these, hence otj-server is also recompiled against this, and
  released in same parent POM.
* In turn this changed JsonRequestLog. Some users extend this, afaik they are not affected.


5.2.1
-----
* Remove LogMetaData.

LogMetaData was a support for arbitrary metadata, used as a transition to selectorless otl-based
logging. It did not function correctly for the last 2 years (swallowed the extra fields). 

If you use LogMetadata, you'll need to create otls in the [logging-config](https://github.com/opentable/logging-loglov3-config) repo
and then build a new otl in the [logging-tools](https://github.com/opentable/logging-tools/tree/master/otj-otl) repo

Alternatively, restructure or eliminate the logging. Unless it perfectly matched an existing OTL
it has not logged correctly for 2 years.

We apologize for the inconvenience.
